// What is node.js?

/*It is a javascript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 used 
to run Javascript code server side Node.js is an open-source, 
cross-platformJavaScript run-time environment for executing 
JavaScript code server-side. Historically, JavaScript was used 
primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in 
JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML, to be run client-side 
by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. Node.js enables 
JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, and runs scripts 
server-side to produce dynamic web pagecontent before the page is 
sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js has become 
one of the foundational elements of the "JavaScript everywhere" 
paradigm, allowing web application development to unify around a 
single programming language, rather than rely on a different language 
ting server side scripts.

// What is an example of the usage of an http session? 
// In other words, what are http sessions for?

/* A session is a server-side storage of information meant to last 
while the web application is in used.HTTP sessions is an industry 
tandard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and 
to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions 
between a client application and a Web application. In computer science,
in particular networking, a session is a semi-permanent interactive 
information interchange, also known as a dialogue, a conversation or 
a meeting, between two or more communicating devices, or between a 
computer and user (see Login session). A session is set up or 
established at a certain point in time, and then torn down at some 
later point. An established communication session may involve more than 
one message in each direction. A session is typically, but not always, 
stateful, meaning that at least one of the communicating parts needs to 
save information about the session history in order to be able to 
communicate, as opposed to stateless communication, where the 
communication consists of independent requests with responses.

// Opportunity for bonus points: mention and explain 2 things which 
// you learned in this course. You may explain by narrative or with 
// an example. Some examples may be: arrow functions, filter, map, 
// reduce, the difference betweem const, let and var, rest parameters, 
// spread operator, modules, etc.

/*(1) I  have learned the difference between const, let and var.  
The const keyword creates a declaration that cannot be reassigned.  
Both var and let have the same behavior with regards to reassignment.  
If not need for reassignment use const and const should be used whenever is possible.  If const is not used, then use let. Furthermore, using const is beneficial because it is making your intention explicit.
 (2)  Arrow functions â€“ are a more concise syntax for writing function 
 expressions. They utilize a new token, => , that looks like a fatarrow. 
 Arrow functions are anonymous and change the way this binds in 
 functions.
